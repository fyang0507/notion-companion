# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Notion Companion is a production-ready AI-powered knowledge assistant that connects to your primary Notion workspace, providing intelligent search and chat capabilities with real-time synchronization. It's a full-stack RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application optimized for single-user, multi-database workflows.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**: Next.js 13.5.1 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
**Backend**: FastAPI (Python with uv package manager), Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector), OpenAI integration
**Key Features**: Vector search, streaming chat, Notion webhook synchronization, single workspace with multi-database filtering

## Development & Testing

### Basic Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Frontend only (port 3000)
- `npm run backend` - Backend only (port 8000) 
- `npm run dev:full` - Both frontend and backend concurrently
- `make dev` - Alternative using Makefile
- `npm run build` - Build Next.js for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint validation (ALWAYS run before committing)

### Backend Operations
- `cd backend && .venv/bin/python scripts/sync_databases.py` - Sync Notion databases
- `cd backend && .venv/bin/python scripts/sync_databases.py --dry-run` - Test sync configuration
- `cd backend && .venv/bin/python scripts/model_config_demo.py` - Test model configuration

### Claude Code Testing Guidelines

**üö´ CRITICAL: NEVER start backend services in Claude Code**
- Commands with `&` cause 2-minute timeouts
- `npm run backend` doesn't persist in Claude Code environment

**‚úÖ CORRECT TESTING WORKFLOW:**
1. Claude identifies need to test backend API
2. Claude asks: "Please start the backend with `npm run backend` so I can test [feature]"
3. User starts backend in their environment  
4. Claude runs curl tests against localhost:8000
5. Claude asks user to stop backend when testing is complete

**‚ö° Fast Component Testing (No Backend Required):**
```bash
# Database connectivity test (5 seconds)
.venv/bin/python -c "import asyncio; from database import init_db; asyncio.run(init_db()); print('‚úì DB OK')"

# OpenAI integration test (10 seconds)  
.venv/bin/python -c "import asyncio; from services.openai_service import get_openai_service; asyncio.run(get_openai_service().generate_embedding('test')); print('‚úì OpenAI OK')"

# Vector search test (15 seconds)
.venv/bin/python -c "
import asyncio
from database import init_db, get_db
from services.openai_service import get_openai_service

async def test():
    await init_db()
    db = get_db()
    openai_service = get_openai_service()
    embedding = await openai_service.generate_embedding('test')
    results = db.vector_search_for_single_workspace(embedding.embedding, 0.1, 3)
    print(f'‚úì Vector search: {len(results)} results')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

**üßπ Process Management:**
- Always kill any background processes at the end of investigations
- Use `pkill -f uvicorn` or `pkill -f python` to clean up
- Component testing is preferred over full server testing for speed

### Logging & Debugging System
- **Log Files**: All logs in `logs/` directory with automatic rotation
  - `app.log` - General application logs (JSON structured)
  - `api.log` - API request/response logs with timing
  - `errors.log` - Error-level logs only
  - `performance.log` - Performance metrics and slow operations
- **Frontend Logging**: Persistent localStorage with `lib/logger.ts`
  - Use `<DebugLogs />` component to view/export frontend logs
  - Request correlation IDs link frontend/backend logs
- **Debugging Workflow**: Check log files first instead of restarting services

### Initial Setup
- `make install` - Install both Python (uv) and Node (pnpm) dependencies
- `make setup-env` - Create environment file template
- Deploy the SQL script from setup guide (`/setup` page) in Supabase
- Set `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN` in environment for single workspace
- **Note**: No workspace setup needed - uses single token for entire app

## Architecture Patterns

### Full-Stack Structure
- **Frontend**: `app/` directory uses Next.js App Router with static export
- **Backend**: `backend/` directory contains FastAPI application with routers and services
- **Components**: Extensive shadcn/ui component library in `components/ui/`
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript definitions in `types/` directory

### RAG Implementation
- Vector embeddings stored in Supabase pgvector
- Configurable OpenAI models via `backend/config/models.toml`
- AI document summarization for large documents (handles 30k+ tokens)
- Hybrid search: document-level (summaries) + chunk-level (detailed content)
- Intelligent chunking with semantic boundary preservation
- Server-Sent Events for streaming chat responses

### API Architecture
- FastAPI routers in `backend/routers/` for organized endpoints
- Service layer in `backend/services/` for business logic
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Main endpoints: `/api/chat` (streaming), `/api/search` (vector), `/api/notion/webhook`

### Database Schema
Enhanced Single-Database Model (v3.0) - NO workspace concept:
- Core tables: `documents`, `document_chunks`, `document_metadata`, `database_schemas`
- **REMOVED**: `workspaces` table completely eliminated
- **NEW**: All operations filter by `database_id` instead of `workspace_id`
- Multimedia support: `multimedia_assets`, `document_multimedia`
- Analytics: `search_analytics` for query tracking (no workspace_id)
- Database schema manager for automatic Notion database analysis
- Uses Supabase Auth for user management and pgvector for similarity search
- Vector functions now take `database_ids[]` instead of `workspace_id`

### Frontend Patterns
- React components with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Custom hooks for state management (`useAuth`, `useNotionConnection`, `useNotionDatabases`)
- Real-time data fetching with Supabase integration
- Database-level filtering in chat and search interfaces
- Theme switching via next-themes (system/light/dark)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
**Frontend**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
**Backend**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN` (single workspace token), plus Supabase credentials

### Model Configuration
Configure models in `backend/config/models.toml`:
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=development` for cheaper models in dev
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` for higher quality models in prod
- Modify model selections directly in the TOML file

## Recent Architecture Changes

### Complete Workspace Concept Removal (v3.0) - December 2024
**MAJOR OVERHAUL**: Completely eliminated workspace concept from entire codebase:

#### ‚úÖ **Design Decision**
After implementing a single workspace model (v2.0), we discovered lingering workspace_id references throughout the codebase. The decision was made to **completely remove the workspace concept** and redesign the application to support **ONLY ONE Notion workspace** with multiple databases.

#### üîÑ **What Changed (Commits: `012b3cc`, `f7f0ab5`)**

**Backend Complete Rewrite:**
- **`notion_webhook.py`**: Now uses `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN` from environment instead of workspace lookup
- **`bootstrap.py`**: Removed `workspace_id` parameters, operates directly on database configs
- **`document_processor.py`**: Removed all `workspace_id` parameters and method signatures
- **`database_schema_manager.py`**: Removed workspace storage, operates per-database only

**Database Schema Overhaul:**
- **DELETED**: `workspaces` table completely removed
- **REMOVED**: All `workspace_id` columns from all tables
- **UPDATED**: Vector search functions now take `database_ids[]` instead of `workspace_id`
- **NEW**: RLS policies updated for single-user, multi-database model

**Frontend Simplification:**
- **TypeScript types**: Completely rewritten to remove workspace references
- **Setup guide**: Updated with single-workspace warnings and new SQL schema
- **Environment**: Changed from workspace selection to single `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN`

#### üéØ **Current Architecture (v3.0)**
- **Single Token**: Uses one `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN` for the entire application
- **Database-Centric**: All operations filter by `database_id`, never by workspace
- **No Workspace Tables**: Zero workspace management in database
- **Explicit Documentation**: Every file clearly states "ONLY ONE workspace"

#### üìã **Migration Path**
- Old multi-workspace data needs manual database migration
- Environment variables changed from workspace configs to single token
- API endpoints now expect database IDs instead of workspace IDs

### Legacy Single Workspace Model (v2.0) - Deprecated
The previous v2.0 approach attempted to simplify multi-workspace to single workspace but retained workspace infrastructure. This has been completely superseded by v3.0's no-workspace model.

## Quality Guidelines

- Always run `npm run lint` before committing changes
- The application uses static export configuration, so ensure all features work without server-side rendering
- See `backend/docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for detailed testing patterns

## Future Considerations

### Potential Multi-Workspace Support (v4.0+)
The current no-workspace model (v3.0) could theoretically be extended to support multiple workspaces in the future, but this would require significant architectural changes:

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The workspace concept was completely removed in v3.0 for good reasons:
- Simplified codebase maintenance
- Reduced complexity in filtering and permissions
- Better performance with direct database-level operations
- Clearer user experience with single workspace focus

**If multi-workspace support is needed in the future:**
- Add `workspaces` table back to database schema
- Restore `workspace_id` columns to relevant tables
- Update all vector search functions to accept workspace filtering
- Rebuild frontend workspace selection UI
- Implement workspace-level permissions and access controls
- Update environment configuration to handle multiple tokens

**Recommendation**: Only implement multi-workspace if there is clear user demand, as the current single-workspace model significantly simplifies the application architecture and user experience.
