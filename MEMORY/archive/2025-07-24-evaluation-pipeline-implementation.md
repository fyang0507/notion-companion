# RAG Evaluation Pipeline Implementation

*Last Updated: 2025-07-24*

## Feature Summary

Built a comprehensive end-to-end evaluation framework for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems with multilingual support and benchmarking capabilities. This system enables systematic evaluation of different chunking strategies and retrieval approaches using standard Information Retrieval metrics.

## Implementation Overview

### Core Components Delivered

- **Multilingual Chunking Pipeline** - Sentence-based and paragraph-based chunking with Chinese/English/French punctuation support
- **Question Generation System** - Automated QA pair generation with content filtering and batch processing
- **Self-Verification System** - LLM-based quality assurance using expanded context and Rouge-L scoring
- **Retrieval Evaluation Framework** - Standard IR metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR, NDCG) with configurable parameters
- **Benchmarking Orchestrator** - Complete pipeline automation from data ingestion to evaluation reporting

### Key Technical Achievements

1. **Robust Multilingual Text Processing** - Handles mixed Chinese-English content with proper sentence boundary detection and quotation mark handling
2. **Embedding Caching System** - Sentence-level caching for 5-10x speed improvement during parameter tuning experiments
3. **Configurable Evaluation Metrics** - Multi-chunk aware metrics with flexible similarity thresholds and Rouge-based ground truth matching
4. **Self-Contained Experiment Runner** - Complete pipeline orchestration with data clearing, ingestion, and evaluation phases

### Configuration-Driven Design

All components are fully configurable through TOML files:
- `benchmark.toml` - Experiment parameters and evaluation settings
- `chunking.toml` - Multilingual text processing configuration
- `question_generation.toml` - QA pair generation settings
- `qa_verification.toml` - Self-verification pipeline parameters

## Business Impact

This evaluation framework enables systematic optimization of RAG system performance through:
- **Data-Driven Chunking Strategy Selection** - Compare paragraph vs sentence-based approaches
- **Parameter Optimization** - Tune chunk size, overlap, and similarity thresholds
- **Quality Assurance** - Verify QA pairs before evaluation to ensure ground truth quality
- **Reproducible Benchmarking** - Standardized evaluation process for consistent comparisons

The system has been verified with real multilingual document collections and produces evaluation reports suitable for optimization decisions.
