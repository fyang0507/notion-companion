# Backend Restructuring Complete

*Date: 2025-07-14*
*Type: Tech Debt Reduction & Refactoring*

## Objective
Migrate backend from monolithic structure to modular 4-module architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Results
• **Modular Architecture**: Successfully separated into ingestion, storage, rag, and api modules
• **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented pluggable retrieval strategies with dynamic registration
• **Experiment Framework**: Added A/B testing and benchmarking capabilities with loose coupling

## Impact
- **Tests Passed**: 5/5 (100% success rate)
- **Module Independence**: Each module can be developed independently
- **Enhanced Experimentation**: Strategy registry enables easy RAG experimentation

## Key Changes
- Clear separation between data ingestion, storage, RAG features, and API
- Pluggable architecture for different retrieval strategies
- Comprehensive experiment framework for performance analysis
