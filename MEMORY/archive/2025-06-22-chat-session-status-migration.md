# Chat Session Status System Migration

*Date: 2025-06-22*
*Type: Feature Enhancement*

## Objective
Upgrade chat session system from two-status (`active`, `deleted`) to three-status system (`active`, `concluded`, `deleted`) ensuring only one conversation is active at a time.

## Results
• **Enhanced Status System** - Added `concluded` status for finished but resumable sessions
• **Single Active Session** - Only one conversation can be active at any time
• **Automatic Organization** - Idle sessions (10+ minutes) automatically conclude and organize

## Implementation
- **Database Schema**: Updated `chat_sessions.status` to include `concluded`
- **Service Layer**: Added `get_active_session()`, `conclude_session()`, `resume_session()` methods
- **API Endpoints**: Added `POST /{session_id}/resume` and `GET /current-active`
- **Frontend Integration**: Status indicators and resume functionality

## Impact
- **Clear UX**: Users always know which conversation is currently active
- **Resumable History**: Easy to resume previous conversations without losing context
- **Performance**: Only one active session reduces resource usage
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Idle sessions automatically transition to concluded state

## Key Features
- Sessions auto-conclude when user goes idle, clicks "New Chat", or resumes different session
- Recent chats show both active and concluded sessions with visual indicators
- Resuming concluded session automatically concludes any currently active session
- Backward compatibility with existing API responses
