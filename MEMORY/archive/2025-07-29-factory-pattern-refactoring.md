# Factory Pattern Refactoring and Domain Relocation - Complete

*Task Type: Tech Debt Reduction & Refactoring*  
*Date: 2025-07-29*

## Summary
Comprehensive refactoring of hard-coded factory functions into a config-driven factory pattern with registry system, followed by relocation to domain-specific locations for better architectural cohesion.

## Problem Addressed
- Hard-coded `get_basic_paragraph_chunker()` and `get_basic_similarity_strategy()` functions limiting extensibility
- Strategy selection required code changes instead of configuration changes
- Tight coupling between strategy instantiation and specific implementations
- No systematic approach for registering new strategies
- Centralized factory location violated domain-driven design principles

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Factory Pattern Implementation
1. **Registry-Based Factory Pattern**
   - ChunkingStrategyRegistry and RetrievalStrategyRegistry for strategy registration
   - ChunkingStrategyFactory and RetrievalStrategyFactory for config-driven instantiation
   - Automatic registration of default strategies with extensibility for new ones

2. **Enhanced Configuration Structure** (`evaluation/config/benchmark.toml`)
   - Added `[strategies.chunking]` section with strategy selection parameter
   - Added `[strategies.retrieval]` section with strategy selection parameter
   - Declarative approach: change strategy by editing config, not code

3. **Strategy Self-Validation Pattern**
   - Implemented `from_config()` class methods in strategy classes
   - Each strategy handles its own configuration validation and parameter extraction
   - Factories pass full configuration dictionaries to strategies
   - Extensible design supports different constructor signatures for future strategies

### Phase 2: Domain Relocation
4. **Factory Relocations to Domain-Specific Locations**
   - **ChunkingStrategyFactory**: Moved to `ingestion/factory.py`
   - **RetrievalStrategyFactory**: Moved to `rag/factory.py`
   - Updated imports in `evaluation/scripts/run_benchmark_basic_rag.py`
   - Removed obsolete `evaluation/factories/` directory

5. **Refactored Benchmark Runner** (`evaluation/scripts/run_benchmark_basic_rag.py`)
   - Replaced direct factory function calls with factory pattern
   - Modularized `run_ingestion()` method to accept chunking strategy parameter
   - Clean separation between configuration parsing and strategy instantiation

## Architecture Evolution
```
BEFORE: Hard-coded Functions → Direct Instantiation
INTERMEDIATE: Config → Registry → Factory → Strategy Instance (centralized)
AFTER: Config → Domain-Specific Factory → Registry → Strategy Instance (distributed)
```

## Key Files Modified
- `ingestion/factory.py` (chunking factory in domain location)
- `rag/factory.py` (retrieval factory in domain location)
- `ingestion/services/basic_paragraph_chunker.py` (added from_config() method)
- `rag/strategies/basic_similarity_strategy.py` (added from_config() method)
- `evaluation/config/benchmark.toml` (added strategies configuration sections)
- `evaluation/scripts/run_benchmark_basic_rag.py` (refactored to use domain factories)

## Technical Benefits

### Extensibility
- ✅ Easy strategy switching through configuration changes only
- ✅ Improved extensibility: new strategies register themselves automatically
- ✅ Registry pattern enables plugin-like strategy additions
- ✅ Strategy classes handle their own config validation

### Architecture
- ✅ Better separation of concerns: factories handle instantiation logic
- ✅ Domain-driven design: factories co-located with their domain logic
- ✅ Improved cohesion with clear ownership boundaries
- ✅ Reduced cross-module dependencies

### Compatibility
- ✅ Maintained async architecture and all existing functionality
- ✅ Full backward compatibility with existing configuration files
- ✅ No breaking changes to evaluation pipeline
- ✅ All existing tests passed without modification

## Strategy Registration Pattern
Each factory maintains a registry mapping strategy names to implementation classes:
```python
# Chunking strategies (ingestion/factory.py)
"basic_paragraph" → BasicParagraphChunker

# Retrieval strategies (rag/factory.py)
"basic_similarity" → BasicSimilarityStrategy
```

## Configuration Example
```toml
[strategies.chunking]
strategy = "basic_paragraph"

[strategies.retrieval] 
strategy = "basic_similarity"
```

## Strategy Self-Validation Pattern
```python
@classmethod
def from_config(cls, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> 'StrategyClass':
    """Create strategy from configuration with self-validation."""
    # Extract required parameters with validation
    # Handle different config structures per strategy
    # Return configured instance
```

## Domain-Specific Import Pattern
```python
# New domain-specific imports
from ingestion.factory import get_chunking_factory
from rag.factory import get_retrieval_factory
```

## Testing Verification
- ✅ All existing tests passed without modification
- ✅ Strategy instantiation working correctly through factory pattern
- ✅ Configuration-driven selection verified functional
- ✅ Domain relocation verified with integration tests
- ✅ Factory pattern flexibility tested with different configurations

## Future Considerations
- Factory pattern can be extended for additional strategy types
- Domain-specific factory locations support better module independence
- Pattern established for future refactoring of centralized components
- Self-validation pattern can be applied to other configurable components
- Registry pattern enables easy discovery of available strategies

## Architectural Impact
This refactoring establishes a clean, extensible foundation for the RAG benchmark system that:
- Supports easy experimentation with different strategies through configuration
- Maintains domain boundaries and ownership
- Enables future strategy additions without factory modifications
- Preserves all existing functionality while improving maintainability
