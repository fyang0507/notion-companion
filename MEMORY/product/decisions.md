- **Single Workspace Only** - Focus on one primary Notion workspace with multiple databases
- **Single User** - Individual tool, not team collaboration, no authentication, log-in management
- **Minimal Code-level Testing** - limited testing and CI/CD, rely on live testing
- **Evaluation-driven** - Experiment with different embedding, retrieval, and processing strategies and configurations to find the best one
