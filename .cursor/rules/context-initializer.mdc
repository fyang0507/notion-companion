# Initialize Context

You are beginning a new task. You need to read the relevant docs in the `MEMORY/` folder and report back the relevant context to the task, follow "Categorize task → Read relevant docs → report back" workflow.

You need to:
1. Read MEMORY/INDEX.md to understand document system structure and the categorization of the task
2. Categorize the task, then read the relevant docs in the `MEMORY/` folder
3. Consolidate the relevant context concisely and report back

- Example reading flow for new feature prototyping:
  - `product/overview.md`, `product/decisions.md` → align with important decisions
  - `engineering/` → technical context: codebase structure, development environment, standards, patterns, etc.
  - `specs/` → selective reading of relevant component specs to understand the implementation details
- Example reading flow for Bug Fix:
  - `engineering/architecture.md` → locate issue
  - `engineering/standards.md`, `engineering/setup.md` → follow development conventions
  - `specs/` → selective reading of relevant component specs
- Additional task types follow similar patterns
